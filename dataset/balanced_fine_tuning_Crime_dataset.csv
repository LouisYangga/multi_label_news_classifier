Mukhtar Ansari: A Career In Crime And Politics,Crime
 From Our Correspondent ISLAMABAD: Participants of `Women Police Networking Symposium’ were of the view that lack of proper recognition of their services hampers women to join police force in the country. Sharing their remarks on the second day of the symposium organised by Women Police Network (WPN) women police officers said female employees of the force have rendered great services and won adulation but their achievements were never acknowledged amicably. They said “Constable Shazia Gul of the Nowshera police was first policewoman of the country to lay down her life in the line of duty and Deputy Superintendent of Police Shahzadi Gulfam received the prestigious International Female Police Peacekeeper Award but their services were not presented as role model for others”. The Speakers further pointed out that taboos and morbid social norms do not facilitate working women in our society. As the society has a stereotypical image of women police is not considered a career of choice for women as they are considered too sentimental excessively passive and considerably tender for a harsh dangerous and extremely challenging work environment they added. It is fact that women are not a significant part of our work force including policing is a good portrayal of our social attitudes which betray severe gender based prejudices prevalent in our society they remarked.,Crime
